# SERAI Business Model & Features

## Core Business Concept

SERAI is a direct-booking marketplace designed for a new generation of boutique hotels, inns, and lodges—positioned as an OYO / Sonder-style "Airbnb" for markets where residential short-term rentals are heavily regulated.

We're targeting cities where STR restrictions have opened the door for licensed hotel properties to reclaim market share—but with a modern, curated experience travelers now expect.

## Key Differentiators

- **Dynamic pricing and revenue optimization**
- **Compelling brand narrative for each property**
- **Integrated upsell tools for experiences, services, and F&B**
- **Frictionless, mobile-first booking UX**
- **Community-driven layer that fosters trust, discovery, and repeat bookings**

Unlike Airbnb, we're not chasing quantity. We're curating quality—offering travelers an elevated stay with the warmth of boutique hospitality and the confidence of consistency.
